# Jira User Scraper

This code snippet is used to parse the contents of Jira's User management page.

Open your brower to https://YOUR.JIRA.SERVER.HERE/secure/admin/user/UserBrowser.jspa and open the developer console (e.g. F12 on Windows + Chrome), copy the contents of `jira-users.js` and paste it in the console. You'll get the results in your clipboard. Then paste the results in e.g. Excel.

You need to do this for each page (the script doesn't scrape anything automatically)
